## TLS/SSL using Boost.Asio

Recently I needed to work on porting code that would perform https GET and POST network requests. This would be ported to iOS. Most of the code was already in C++ but since the code did not need to stay portable, I took some advantage of [Grand Central Dispatch (GCD).](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref/index.html) 

 There are a lot of samples on how to use Boost.Asio to make regular HTTP requests: [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_47_0/doc/html/boost_asio/example/http/client/async_client.cpp](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_47_0/doc/html/boost_asio/example/http/client/async_client.cpp).
 
Examples of TLS support available for socket connections can be found here:
[http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_42_0/doc/html/boost_asio/example/ssl/server.cpp](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_42_0/doc/html/boost_asio/example/ssl/server.cpp)
[http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_42_0/doc/html/boost_asio/example/ssl/client.cpp](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_42_0/doc/html/boost_asio/example/ssl/client.cpp)

However there isn't ample information on how to convert regular HTTP request examples to TLS ones. Furthermore, there seems to be a lot of questions circulating on forums as to how to accomplish this.

Basically, in order to do this task from the above [HTTP example](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_47_0/doc/html/boost_asio/example/http/client/async_client.cpp), it requires converting the private member variable:

	tcp::socket socket_;

into a

	boost::asio::ssl::stream<boost::asio::ip::tcp::socket> socket_;

Therefor this blog is a walk through of my experience turning Boost's HTTP request examples into an SSL example, while making it work smoothly on iOS. This code is by no means finished, but is merely a test example.

Here is the [source code](https://github.com/CollinStuart/BoostAsioTLS) for the class with the converted socket_ ivar.

Notice in the constructor we can pass in a string of post parameters (in the format "key1=value1&key2=value2"). HTTP 1.1 uses [chunked transfer-encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding) which means that numbers will appear before and after the response. HTTP 1.0 does not do this, though usually requires a "Connection: close" in the header. For the post request case, I do  not add a "Connection: close" header as we may not get the rest of the data if we do this. Also, the protocol depicts that after the last header before the post body there should be an "/r/n/r/n" so the protocol knows the content is coming next. The last line of content should also have an "/r/n/r/n" so the protocol knows where the end of the content is.

There are two static class methods that you can use - getRequest and postRequest. Keeping somewhat in the style of modern network API's such as [AFNetworking](http://afnetworking.com/), these functions have callbacks where you can pass in a Lambda function, similar to callback blocks in Objective-C.

Inside these post and get requests, I am actually spawning a thread. Although Boost.Asio has an asynchronous model, I have found that it has not fully been tested and optimized for iOS. Instead I am using the standard thread library but you could just as easily use GCD (more on this later for the callback functions).

	NetworkManager* NetworkManager::getRequest(string urlString, string paramString, std::function<void(string responseString)> callback)
	{
	    std::thread thread(_threadWork, urlString, paramString, "", callback);
	    thread.detach();
	    return NULL;
	}
	
	NetworkManager* NetworkManager::postRequest(string urlString, string pathString, string postParams, std::function<void(string responseString)> callback)
	{
	    std::thread thread(_threadWork, urlString, pathString, postParams, callback);
	    thread.detach();
	    return NULL;
	}

A future task is to rewrite some of the code so we can get a pointer back of the particular request, however right now for this example we are simply returning NULL. The various callback functions of the original Boost example will still be performed (handle_resolve, handle_connect, handle_handshake, etc). Inside the handle_read_content, I am going to use GCD to perform the callback function back on the main thread. 

	void NetworkManager::handle_read_content(const boost::system::error_code& err)
	{    
	    if (err == boost::asio::error::eof)
	    {
	        // Write all of the data that has been read so far.
	
	        _responseString << &response_;
	        
	        _dispatchOnMainThreadWithResponseString(_responseString.str());
	    }
	    else if (!err)
	    {
	        // Write all of the data that has been read so far.
	        //cout << &response_ << endl;
	        
	        //cout << _responseString.str() << endl;
	        _responseString << &response_;
	        
	        // Continue reading remaining data until EOF.
	        boost::asio::async_read(socket_, response_,
	                                boost::asio::transfer_at_least(1),
	                                boost::bind(&NetworkManager::handle_read_content, this,
	                                            boost::asio::placeholders::error));
	
	    }
	}


Lets take a look inside the  _dispatchOnMainThreadWithResponseString and corresponding Go function

	void Go(pair<function<void(string)>, string> *thePair)
	{
	    if (thePair)
	    {
	        string dataString = thePair->second;
	        function<void(string)> f = thePair->first;
	        f(dataString);
	        delete thePair;
	        thePair = NULL;
	    }
	}
	
	void NetworkManager::_dispatchOnMainThreadWithResponseString(string dataString)
	{
	    pair< function<void(string)>, string > *thePair = new pair< function<void(string)>, string >;
	    function<void(string)> f(_callbackFunction);
	    thePair->first = f;
	    thePair->second = dataString;
	    
	    //Pass in the callback function as context so it doesn't get destroyed
	    dispatch_async_f(dispatch_get_main_queue(), thePair, (dispatch_function_t)Go);
	}

If we were to use the more common [dispatch_async](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref/index.html#//apple_ref/c/func/dispatch_async) function here, as soon as dispatch_async executed, the _callbackFunction variable would go out of scope because our class would have been deallocated after the request had finished being processed. We need to hold on to the variable to still execute the callback function that the user passed in upon making a network request. A solution would be to somehow copy the std::function into dispatch_async_f as a context. Note that although [std::function::target](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/function/target) gives you a raw pointer to the function that we could make use of, when it's a Lambda function, the function is missing state such as capture variables, so this method simply returns NULL. Therefore, we just package them together into a pair; the function wrapped as a std::function which includes scope, and the data string as the second part of the pair.
    
I used GCD because std::thread does not provide any way of dispatching a function on the GUI/main thread as there is no concept of main threads in the library (for portability reasons). (The main thread conceptually is just the initial starting thread.)

For testing the functionality, you can uncomment some of the cout statements. If your coming from the "NSLog" world, note that cout to the standard console from multiple threads is not guaranteed to be synchronized. Using cout with streams, especially without std::endl at end can fill the buffer and cout can just stop working when you need to use it. You can either flush, or comment out the couts for streams.

        cout << std::flush;
        cout << _responseString.str() << endl;

Here are some examples of using the class interface:

	string paramString("device_id=12345");
    NetworkManager::postRequest("www.example.com", "/somepath/login.php", paramString, [this](std::string responseString)
        {
            cout << "The response is " << responseString << endl;
        });


	NetworkManager::getRequest("www.example.com", "/somepath/somecall.php", [this](std::string responseString)
	    {
	           cout << "Response is " << responseString << endl;
	     });

and again, [here](https://github.com/CollinBStuart/BoostAsioTLS) is the full code. This code is by no means complete. I would like to add a fail block and other error checking as well as certificate verification. (Replace verify_none with verify_peer for set_verify_mode and add your pem file to the project - we need to call set_verify_mode(boost::asio::ssl::verify_peer) and load_verify_file("ca.pem"); ) However I thought I would share it for anyone else who finds themselves in the same situation as I have. Since this blog is often dedicated to less common scenarios, it seems a perfect fit.
