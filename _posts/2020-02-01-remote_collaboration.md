## Secure Apps to Continue Working Remotely During COVID19

With COVID19 we're all trying to cope by continuing to work with online sessions and remote communication. Some professionals that have to do their work in person to discuss private matters, such as lawyers, financial advisers or therapists, have been asking how to continue to work remotely without risking privacy. I've curated a list of apps that allow for secure and encrypted communications. Activists, investigators and whistle-blowers have used these apps for their work. 

### Chat

#### [Signal](https://signal.org)
Signal is an encrypted chat app that is available for Android, iPhone, and desktop computers. Messages get encrypted so that only the sender and receiver can read them. (called end-to-end encryption). You can also choose to have messages disappear after a specific time once viewed. 

#### [Retroshare](https://retroshare.cc)
A privacy equivalent to Slack. Offers encrypted connections between you and your acquaintances to create a network of computers. It also provides various distributed services: forums, channels, chat and mail. Retroshare is a decentralized network designed to provide security and anonymity to its users. Retroshare is free and open-source software. Open Sourced means that the full code for the program is open to the public so that security researches can audit it to make sure there are no weaknesses or back doors. 

#### [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/) 
An alternative open sourced collaboration software to the above.

### Cloud Collaboration
#### [CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr/) 
The Zero Knowledge Cloud In the current health crisis linked to the COVID-19 outbreak, CryptPad supports remote working. The storage limit for all registered users is increased to 1GB until further notice. Registration is free and there's no personal data required. 

Proprietary services like Google Drive and Dropbox have weakness; the companies can access all the documents you've opted to send to them. Cryptpad is free, open sourced and uses a blockchain for a zero-knowledge platform for collaborative document editing. This ensures only the people working on the documents have access to them. 

It offers common features such as presentations, sheets, notes and whiteboards. 

#### [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com) 
NextCloud is an alternative open sourced project to CryptPad. It provides document syncing and sharing that also respects your privacy. Some of the features it includes are Contacts, Calendar, Video calls, Mail and Newsreaders. 

#### [Riseup](https://riseup.net)
Riseup is special in that it offers many collaboration features. First, users can encrypt and share files via [share.riseup.net](https://share.riseup.net). It also offers a VPN, as well as an Email service. Many activists have chosen this platform for their work. 

#### Using Tor? - [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org/) 
OnionShare is an open source tool for securely and anonymously sending and receiving files using Tor onion services. TorBrowser acts like the Firefox internet browser but hides your location from sites youâ€™re visiting. It does this by concealing your IP address through a series of virtual tunnels. 

#### Too difficult to switch platforms - [CryptoMator](https://cryptomator.org/) 

This is a secure solution if you have to use Google Drive or DropBox. It encrypts folders with a password. That way, it provides transparent document protection from unauthorized access. It's free and open source. You can test it out with one folder in the cloud and have people try out CryptoMator while the rest of the drive stays untouched, 

### Calenders
#### [Etesync](https://www.etesync.com/) 
Etesync offers private encrypted calendars and contacts. It uses end-to-end encryption for syncing your contacts, calendars and tasks. 

### Passwords
#### [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) 
The problem with many password managers are that they are proprietary and closed source; there's no guarantee the company has not put in a back door allowing them access to your passwords. When it comes to a master place that stores your passwords, it's important that this is secure. The full code of KeePassXC is is open for public review. It stores the passwords encrypted and the app works on many different platforms. That's it for now. This list will get updated as new as I conduct more research.

Last but not least, while the topic of financial privacy is beyond the scope of this article, I'll briefly mention an alternative and private way to exchange currency in a world this is going cashless. 

### Cryptocurrency

#### Cryptocurrency - [Monero](https://web.getmonero.org)
Monero is a cryptocurrency that solves many of the privacy and security issues of Bitcoin. 

#### Cryptocurrency exchange network - [Bisq](https://bisq.network) 
Banks and governments have forced many companies to undo security. For example, while cryptocurrency solves the privacy problem, many organizations are requiring government ID and photographs to do purchasing or exchanges. Bisq is the opposite of that. It's a private exchange network that does not not require you to submit your personal information to do exchanges and transactions. 

### Where To Go From Here
That's it for now. For more information about security and privacy, see the suggestions in my <a href="https://kolinsturt.github.io/lessons/2018/06/01/privacy_activists_investigators">Privacy Tips for Investigators</a> article.
